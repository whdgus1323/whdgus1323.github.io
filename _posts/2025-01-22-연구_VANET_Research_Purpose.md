## üöÄ Introduction
The **Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV)** routing protocol is a cornerstone of wireless ad hoc networks, including **Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs)**. It dynamically establishes routes only when required, optimizing network efficiency.

---

## üåü Key Features of AODV
- **Reactive Routing**: Creates routes **on-demand**, reducing overhead from unused paths.
- **Route Discovery**: Utilizes **Route Request (RREQ)** and **Route Reply (RREP)** messages for efficient route setup.
- **Route Maintenance**: Ensures robust communication via **Route Error (RERR)** messages.
- **Sequence Numbers**: Guarantees up-to-date routes while avoiding loops.

## üí° How AODV Works

```mermaid
graph TD
A[Source Node] -->|RREQ| B[Intermediate Node]
B -->|RREQ| C[Destination Node]
C -->|RREP| B
B -->|RREP| A
A -->|Data Packet| C
```

1. **Route Discovery**:
   - The source node broadcasts a **RREQ** to find the destination.
   - Each intermediate node forwards the RREQ until it reaches the destination.

2. **Route Reply**:
   - The destination sends back a **RREP** to establish the path.

3. **Data Transmission**:
   - Data packets are sent through the established route.

4. **Route Maintenance**:
   - Link failures trigger **RERR** messages to repair or remove routes.

## üîë AODV Parameters

| **Parameter**          | **Description**                                           |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Active Route Time**  | Time a route remains active without usage.                |
| **Delete Period (DPC)**| Wait time before removing a broken route.                 |
| **Sequence Numbers**   | Ensures fresh, loop-free routing paths.                   |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools for Simulation

AODV is often evaluated using powerful simulation tools:

- **NS-3**: Modular network simulation framework with AODV support.
- **SUMO**: Simulates realistic vehicular mobility for VANET scenarios.
- **OSM**: Provides real-world map data for accurate modeling.

---

## üìä Performance Metrics

Key metrics for evaluating AODV performance include:

- **Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR)**: Percentage of packets successfully delivered.
- **Throughput**: Total successful data delivery rate.
- **End-to-End Delay**: Average time for a packet to reach its destination.

---

## üåà Advantages and Limitations

### ‚úÖ Advantages
- Minimal overhead due to on-demand routing.
- Adaptable to dynamic network topologies.
- Supports both unicast and multicast communication.

### ‚ùå Limitations
- Initial route discovery introduces latency.
- Performance may degrade in dense or highly mobile networks.
- Scalability issues in very large networks.

---

## üéØ Conclusion
The **AODV routing protocol** is vital for dynamic and efficient communication in ad hoc and vehicular networks. While it has limitations, its adaptability and simplicity make it a preferred choice for many applications.
